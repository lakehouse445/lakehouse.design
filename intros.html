            <h2>Muse</h2>
            <p>
                G'day! I'm Muse, and I hail from the land down under—Australia. I first joined Homigrad in September and instantly fell in love with the game. 
                Unfortunately, the trolls and griefers made it hard to enjoy, so I decided to step up. After submitting 14 moderator applications, I realized there 
                had to be another way to make a difference. That’s when I found the Moderator’s Deputies program, and the rest is history. 
                With 44 hours of playtime and a personal best of 15 seconds from rule-break to ban, I take great pride in keeping the community safe.
                I’m passionate about administration and always happy to lend a hand when duty calls.

            <h2>Lakehouse</h2>
            <p>
                Hey, I’m Lakehouse, the head of the Moderator’s Deputies program. I started this initiative to give talented players a platform to showcase their skills 
                after seeing so many rejected moderator applications. My Homigrad journey began in September 2024, and I was struck by how many rule-breakers went unchecked. 
                While my moderator application didn’t get approved, I didn’t let that stop me. I worked closely with the mod team to create the Moderator’s Deputies program, 
                and today, I oversee our entire task force. It’s been incredible to see what we’ve accomplished together!

            <h2>Nancy</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Nancy! While I don’t talk much (I’m mute), I make up for it with action and plenty of texts. 
                You’ll often find me chatting on Steam, playing Homigrad, or upholding the rules with dedication and style. 
                I thrive on keeping the peace in the face of griefers and love using my favorite emojis to keep things light-hearted. 
                Gaming has always been my passion, and protecting this community makes it all the more worthwhile. 
                If you see me in the game, don’t hesitate to say hi—I’ll text back right away!

            <h2>Archibald</h2>
            <p>
                Hey, I’m Archibald. I’m not one for the spotlight, but I’ve been part of the Moderator’s Deputies team for some time now. 
                While I’m not always around, when I do show up, you can bet I’m ready to lay down the law. I enjoy keeping things fun 
                and relaxed while taking care of rule-breakers with precision and efficiency. I like to mess around and have a laugh, 
                but when duty calls, I’m all business. Let’s just say I let my actions speak louder than my words.
